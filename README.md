🎮 Coin Collector
Welcome to my GitHub! This is a game I created using Unreal Engine 5 as part of a final challenge for the C++ and Unreal course.

📝 Project Overview
Project Name: Coin Collector
Description:
This game was developed during a timed speed challenge to quickly design and build a playable demo using Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints, Visual Studio, and C++.

I created a custom Level Generator in C++ that dynamically spawns coins and small glowing obstacles throughout the level.
The objective is simple: collect all the coins to win.

🔧 Features
Procedural level generation using C++

Dynamic coin and obstacle spawning

Visual feedback using glowing effects

Built entirely using UE5 tools + C++
